# 📚 Library Management Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a **Library Management System** using **MySQL**, focusing on how books are issued and returned across different library branches. The aim is to uncover insights into library operations, usage patterns, and staff involvement through SQL-based data exploration.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design and analyze a relational database representing library workflows
- Store and manage data using MySQL
- Perform meaningful SQL queries to derive insights
- Identify trends in book issuing, returning, and employee performance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Language**: SQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench

## 🗃️ Database Structure

The core tables in this project include:

- `books`: Stores information about each book in the system
